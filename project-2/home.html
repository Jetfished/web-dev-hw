                Here is a short frame by frame animation I made for Introduction to Animation. If you study hard and only give up when the lack of sleep is causing hallucinations you might be able to put something together like this at the ed of this Instructable.

              I've put together this table so that you can see some of the divisions of work, money and happiness which come along with a project like this.
            </p>
             <table>
                <tr>
                   <th></th>
                   <th scope="col">Pre-Production</th>
                   <th scope="col">Production</th>
                   <th scope="col">Post-Production</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <th scope="row"><h2>Work</h2>
                   <p>When you are making something that is hand drawn and then painted and then scanned and compiled into a moving picture there are a lot of repetitious tasks which must be performed in order. This is the amount of time you should set aside to complete each phase of the project.
                  </th>
                   <td>1-2 Hours</td>
                   <td>16-24 Hours</td>
                   <td>4-5 Hours</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <th scope="row"><h2>Money</h2>
                   <p>I'm not saying this is the cheapest way to get this done. I use a lot of madern technology like LED lightboards and an editing suite. I am sure you could find ways to do this project without spending a dime but this is not that Instructable.
                   </P>
                  </th>
                   <td>$100.00</td>
                   <td>$30.00</td>
                   <td>$50.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <th scope="row"><h2>Happiness</h2>
                   <p>This is your relative ease of being and comfortableness within the world. As you can see, the time this project requires and the severe repetition and reiteration involved can be taxing.
                   </p></th>
                   <td>Mildly Happy</td>
                   <td>Ecstaticly Happy</td>
                   <td>Mildly Happy</td>
                </tr>
