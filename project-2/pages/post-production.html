         <h2>Scan</h2>
         <p>For this step I have used an Epson Perfection V39. It is one of many reasonably priced scanners on the market.</p>
         <p>I scanned my images as .tiff files at 300 ppi because I love the delicious textures and colors that a high resolution image has. Although the large file sizes seemed to work fine in Premiere I found that they broke DragonFrame. I would recommend scanning at a lower resolution if you are not sure about your ability to process large files.

         <h2>Export</h2>
         <p>Premiere offers many formats which you can export your content into. I exported my content as an mp4 and then uploaded it to Youtube.
         </p>
         <p>There are many video hosting sites on the internet. I use Youtube due to it's ubiquity. Vimeo is another option and I'm sure that a quick search will turn up many more.</p>

           <ol>
             <li>Export your sequence in the format of your choice</li>
             <li>Upload your content to a streaming video service</li>
             <li>Share your creation with the world</li>
             <li>Do one of two things:
               <ul>
                 <li>Draw back your curtains, interact with other humans, try not to dream about it too much ...</li>
                 <li><strong><em>OR</em></strong></li>
                 <li>Begin Pre-Production on your next animation</li>
