         <h2>Scan</h2>
         <p>For this step I have used an Epson Perfection V39. It is one of many reasonably priced scanners on the market.</p>
         <p>I scanned my images as .tiff files at 300 ppi because I love the delicious textures and colors that a high resolution image has. Although the large file sizes seemed to work fine in Premiere I found that they broke DragonFrame. I would recommend scanning at a lower resolution if you are not sure about your ability to process large files.
         </p>
         <p>
           <ol>
             <li>Prepare a folder for your scans</li>
             <li>Scan frames 001 to 096</li>
             <li>Think about what normal people might be doing right now</li>
             <li>Convince yourself that it is alright that you havent seen daylight in a week</li>
           </ol>

         <p>
           <ol>
             <li>Boot up Adobe Premiere</li>
             <li>Import your files to a Media Library <strong><em>OR</em></strong> pull them up on the Media Browser</li>
             <li>Set the amount of time in <em>24th of a second intervals</em> which you want your frames to be seen. For example I set my frames to be viewed for 1/12 of a second</li>
             <li>Build a title card and an end card for your project</li>
             <li>Place your frames in sequence between the title card and the end card</li>
             <li>Imagine your friends all together in one place at some very enjoyable party, at this point they have moved on with their lives and you are a distant memory</li>

         <h2>Export</h2>
         <p>Premiere offers many formats which you can export your content into. I exported my content as an mp4 and then uploaded it to Youtube.
         </p>
         <p>There are many video hosting sites on the internet. I use Youtube due to it's ubiquity. Vimeo is another option and I'm sure that a quick search will turn up many more.</p>
         <p>
           <ol>
             <li>Export your sequence in the format of your choice</li>
             <li>Upload your content to a streaming video service</li>
             <li>Share your creation with the world</li>
             <li>Do one of two things:
               <ul>
                 <li>Draw back your curtains, interact with other humans, try not to dream about it too much ...</li>
                 <li><strong><em>OR</em></strong></li>
                 <li>Begin Pre-Production on your next animation</li>
