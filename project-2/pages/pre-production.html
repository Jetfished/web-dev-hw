             <h2>Clean Your Workspace</h2>
             <p>At some point during this project you are going to have one hundred or so individual drawings sopping wet with a watercolor wash, You are going to need space, and lots of it, preferably someplace where you can stand up while you are working. Dirt, grime, pizza sauce, whatever it is marring your work surface has got to go. I recommend a coarse sponge and white cider vinegar.

             <h1>Practice your &quot;Hand&quot;</h1>
             <p>This is the point at which you draw until you are no longer aware of your drawings. Draw until you no longer see what you have made. Draw until your hands instinctively seek out a blank page and you have no concern for the last thing you drew. The last thing you drew is unimportant, what is important is the next page, and the next page and so on until you are like an animation version of John Henry, pounding away at an impossible task despite the onset of automation, become a machine, thoughtlessly driving the pistons of your drawing hand forward until you can see the light of day underneath that mountain. Remember how replaceable you are and let that be your fuel.</p>
