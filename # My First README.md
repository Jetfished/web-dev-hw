I chose this class because I have not kept up with HTML and CSS. I feel it is important as an artist to be conversant with the most current method of delivery for content. I'm planning on approaching this knowledge in the same way that I once learned to stretch a canvas and gesso it in preparation for paint. 

- Vint Cerf,
- Bob Khan,
- Paul Baran,
- these are some names which I had forgotten before watching Q&A with the Internet.

- lovely presentation though.
