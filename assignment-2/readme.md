I usually finish the readings before I begin the assignment. This week I received *HTML & CSS* **by John Druckett** in the mail and I fell into an **HTML** trance, just idly flipping pages until I got to *citing* which reminded me that I had an assignment due.
Once I sat down and began the tutorials I found this to be an interesting lesson in the management of files. It's very satisfying when the paths all work.
